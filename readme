A simple Angular application used for searching parks.  The park search can be VERY vast by searching on the main page or a more centralized and precise search can be made using the advanced search feature.  
This is just  a BETA version and still has a long way to go before it's considered DONE, but it's functional.

In future versions, I fully anticipate have mapping capabilities including zip code radius searches, custom search settings stored on the device, and a heavily expanded database of parks.


But as one man, in his infancy of an IT career, creating all this will take time. I appreciate your patience.
